# Project 2: Votiing Application

The Voting Application is a program that allows people to vote between multiple options and have the results automatically tallied. Votes will count up on each vote cast and the results will be saved to an account on the Solana network.

## Running This Project

Run the following commands:

```
npm i
cd anchor
anchor build
```

## Challenges

There are a few challenges you can take on to extend this project:

1. **Easy**: Allow multiple polls to be run at the same time in the UI.
2. **Hard**: Limit votes to one per signer.
