# Project 1: Favorites Application

This is a basic Anchor app using PDAs to store data for a user, and Anchor's account checks to ensure each user is only allowed to modify their own data.

It's used by the [https://github.com/solana-developers/professional-education](Solana Professional Education) course.

We recommend creating a separate github repository for each project and commiting your code as you follow along the video.
